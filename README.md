# User-Experience-Design

## The-Strategy-Plan

### Site-Goals
The site is aimed for restaurant staff to easily manage the daily menus on the website, keep track of the costomers' feedbacks to monitor the quality of the food and reply to each review for better customer care pratice. 

The site also aims to provide customers the opportunity to leave reviews and make suggestions to the restaurant menus. They can also rate the food from 1 to 5 based on their experience and an average rating is automatically generated for indival dish. 

### Agile Planning

This project was developed through applying agile methodologies by delivering small features in incremental sprints.

All projects were assigned to epics, which were broken into small tasks and prioritized as must have, should have, could have. "Must have" stories were completed first before "should haves", and the last "could haves". To ensure all core requirements completed first gives a complete product, with the nice to have features being added if the time frame allows.

The O.A.T User Story was created using github projects and can be located [here](https://github.com/users/yuyizhong/projects/4) and can be viewed for more information on the project cards. All stories except documentation tasks have a full set of acceptance criteria to mark the story is completed.

#### Epics

The project had 8 main Epics (milestones):

**EPIC 1 - Base Setup**

The base setup epic was the first epic to be delivered as all other features depend on the completion of the base setup.

**EPIC 2 - Small Pages**

Instead of creating epics for tiny features, all the small pages were included to this epic.

**EPIC 3 - Authentication Epic**

The authentication epic is for all stories related to the registration, login and authorization of views. It allows restaurant staff to CRUD menus and reply to user’s reviews securely and users to leave their messages after signed in.

**EPIC 4 - Menu**

The menu epic is for all stories that relate to the creating, editing, toggling, deleting, and viewing of menus. This allows for regular users to view menus and for staff to manage them with a simple UI interface.

**EPIC 5 – Reviews and Ratings**

The Reviews epic is for all stories related to creating, viewing the reviews and ratings to displayed menus at website. This allows the site users to easily view feedbacks of individual menu and also for signed in customers to leave reviews and ratings.

**EPIC 6 - Reply**

The Reply epic is for all stories related to creating, viewing the replies to customers’ reviews. This allows the site users to view the reply messages and also the restaurant staff to reply to user’s feedbacks.

**EPIC 7 - Deployment Epic**

This epic is for all stories related to deploying the app to heroku so that the site is live for staff and customer use.

**EPIC 8 - Documentation**

This epic is for all documents related stories and tasks to document the lifecycle of the project development. It aims to record the detailed documentations to all stages of development and necessary information on testing, deploying and running the application.

#### User Stories

**Differences to Design**

The layout of the menu contents was different. It originally designed as the menu image on the top and the other menu contents and 2 buttons under the images. As the images taking unnecessary space and looking ood at a large screen, I changed the layout to having the image take 60% on the left and the other contents and 2 buttons on the right side.  

### Database-Design

The database was designed to allow CRUD functionality to be available to registered users, when signed in. The MenuItem model is at the heart of the application as it is connected the the Review, linked by primary/foreign key relationships.

The MenuItems model holds objects that are linked to the Menu Models by a many to many relationship. This allows for staff to create menus with many menu items on.

Reply is related to Review by a Foreign Key which allows the manager to reply to individual review of a particular menu item id.

Entity relationship diagram was created using [Dbeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) and shows the schemas for each of the models and how they are related.

![Entity Relationship Diagram](docs/readme_images/erd.jpg)


### Security

In addition to define different users for different accesses/activates at html, PermissionDenied was imported from django.core.exceptions to views to ensure that users who is trying to access unauthorized pages is not permitted. It provids additional security at the views level.

Environment variables were stored in an env.py for local development for security purposes. It ensures no secret keys, api keys or sensitive information were added the repository. In production, these variables were added to heroku config vars within the project.

## The-Surface-Plan
### Design

### Colour-Scheme

The main colour schemes for the website is grey (rgba(0,0,0,.15)
 )as the bg colour throughout of the pages. Both nav bar and footer are dark bg and light text. As the menu pictures are very colourful, most of the text at body is in black font (#000). I did add green to the main titles of each page and blue to manager replies to differentiate sections. Blue and gray are used for buttons. Logo and Up arrow are also in Blue. Rating stars are in yellow.

### Typography

The Roboto and Lato font were used throughout the website. They are from google fonts and imported into the style sheet.

### Imagery

The Website logo was formed from restaurant slogan:”Original Ingredients”, “Authentic Recipe” and “Traditional Method”.
